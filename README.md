# univjobs-front
This is a historical clone of the React-Redux front repo for Univjobs.

## About Univjobs
Univjobs is a platform that we built for students to connect to work, internships and gigs near campus. Just hitting 100+ users, we wanted to build a recruiting platform to make it easier for employers to find the right co-ops and new hires, and easier for small business owners to post their first job postings.

## About this repo
This repo is a historical clone of our Gitlab repository that we predominantly work in. This work is here to show potential employers and clients the quality of the code in which they can expect while working with the primary developer, [Khalil Stemmler](http://khalilstemmler.com).
